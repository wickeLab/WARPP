          <h4>1 Collection and processing of personal data</h4>
          <p>The WARPP-portal differentiates between registered users and visitors. Registered users are able to provide and edit taxonomic data to the WARPP-portal. Visitors are users who can access this research data without any registration. Different privacy protection policies apply to the groups of non-registered users and registered users (see paragraphs 2 and 3). The collection and processing of the research data is handled according to the rules of the Federal Ministry of Education and Research as founding agency and the policies of the German Research Foundation (DFG). Privacy protection of research data is explained in paragraph 4.</p>
          <h4>2 Collected personal data of non-registered users</h4>
            <p>The following data are collected from non-registered visitors of the WARPP-portal:

              <ul><li>IP-address, time stamp, browser-identification, requested pages within the WARPP-portal</li></ul>

        <p>These data are stored for 14 days to allow us to recognize and defend attacks on the WARPP-portal server.</p>

        <p>In addition, the following data will be stored on the visitor’s device for convenience of the WARPP-portal usage:</p>

              <ul><li>So called cookies with a unique identifier</li></ul>

              Cookies are small text files saved on or by the web browser, installed on the user’s computer system. Cookies are often saved on the user’s operating system whenever a user accesses a website. The file contains a distinctive sequence of characters which enables the browser to correctly identify a website when it is visited again. We use cookies to improve the user friendliness of our website. Some elements on our website make it necessary to identify a querying browser after a page change.
              The setting and storage of cookies can be completely prevented by disallowing them in your browsers settings. Alternatively, the storage of cookies can be limited to the time period of your browser session.
            </p>
          <h4>3 Collected personal data of registered users</h4>
            <p>Users of the WARPP-portal can register to be able to create and edit taxonomic and sequencing data. To be able to contact registered users about changes to the portal important to their interests the following information is stored:

              <ul>
                <li>Name and email address of the user</li>
                <li>Affiliation in a research institute</li>
              </ul>

        <p>These data are only collected in agreement with the respective user. Users are informed about data collection and asked to accept this privacy policy when they register at the WARPP-portal.</p>

        <p>In addition to the data collected for non-registered users (see paragraph 2) the following data are collected when users are registered:</p>

              <ul>
                <li>Cookies with the name of the user and the date and time of their login</li>
                <li>Cookies with a unique identifier</li>
              </ul>

              These cookies are used to manage the access of the users to their resources on the portal (upload data, access research data, and account management). The setting of cookies can be prohibited by disallowing cookies via the browser preferences. Prohibiting cookies will disable the usage of the WARPP-portal as registered user.<br>
            </p>
          <h4>4 Collection of personal data in the research data</h4>
            <p>The goal of the WARPP-portal is to collect research data about occurrences and host-parasite-relationships of parasitic plants. For quality assurance and reusability of the research data it is important to have a complete documentation of data collection. Therefore, the research data stored and processed by the WARPP-portal system contain personal data, like photographer names. These are data provided by the registered users when they upload photos of plants. In short, the data contain:

              <ul>
                <li>Name(s) of the photographers that have taken the picture</li>
                <li>Locality and date of the photo location, with coordinates and possibly a locality description</li>
              </ul>

        <p>These data are made publicly available under the condition that the collector has given his / her permission. The permission to publish the data can be revoked on the level of single photos after consultation of the responsible WARPP contact person.</p>

        <p>When a registered user uploads personal data of people that are not registered in the WARPP-portal (e. g. a person that took a picture of a plant) the registered user must have the permit to upload these data to the WARPP-portal. In addition, the registered user must have informed the persons about the usage of their personal data in the WARPP-portal. People whose data have been provided to the research data by registered users have the same rights on requesting, correction and deletion of their personal data as registered users.</p>

        <p>According to research data management policies of the German Research Foundation (DFG) the collected research data with the contained personal data are stored for at least 10 years:</p>

              </ul>
            </p>
          <h4>5 Sharing and disclosure of personal data to third parties</h4>
            <p>The collected research data will be published in order to fulfill the scientific goal of the WARPP-project and make the results available to the interested public, researchers, as well as scientific and administrative institutions. The personal data of collectors can be anonymized before publication when experts request it. The anonymization can be done after consultation with the responsible WARPP contact person. The request can be send to the person responsible for this web portal (see address below).</p>

            <p>This web application is hosted on a Digital Ocean cloud server. Digital Ocean services are in agreement with the regulations of the GDPR which is documented in its Data Processing agreement.</p>
